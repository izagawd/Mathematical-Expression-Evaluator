<h2>Summary</h2>
A simple interpreted programming language made with rust.
Only numbers (whole and decimal) work in this lang. theres no negative numbers (compromise with 0 - x until i feel like adding negative numbers)
variable declaration:
spawn foo = 4;

once a variable is declared it cannot change.

printing:

yap(foo + (5 * 5));

NOTE: a semicolon represents end of a line
<H2>EXAMPLE USAGE</h2>

Input:

spawn a = (5 * 5) +  (5* 5); yap(a);

expected output:

50

NOTE: Since input is from a console, you cant make new lines. so use ";" to indicate a new line. press enter when done
