<h2>Summary</h2>
A simple interpreted programming language made with rust.
Only numbers (whole and decimal) work in this lang. 

NOTE: There's no negative numbers (compromise with 0 - x until I feel like adding negative numbers)

variable declaration:
```
spawn foo = 4;
```
NOTE: Once a variable is declared it cannot change.

printing:
```
yap(foo + (5 * 5));
```
NOTE: a semicolon represents end of a line
<H2>EXAMPLE USAGE</h2>
NOTE: Once u run the rust program, the terminal would ask for input. The input is the code. 
<BR></BR>SIMULATING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU RUN IT:

```
ENTER CODE:
spawn a = (5 * 5) +  (5* 5); yap(a);

50
```
NOTE: Since input is from a console, you cant make new lines. so use ";" to indicate a new line. press enter when done
