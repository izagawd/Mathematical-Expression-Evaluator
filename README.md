<h2>Summary</h2>
A simple interpreted programming language made with rust.

<h2>VARIABLE DECLARATION</h2>
bag foo = 4;

<h2>PRINTING</h1>
```
bag foo = 4;
yap(foo + (5 * 5));
```
NOTE: a semicolon represents end of a line
<H2>IF/ELSE</h2>
```
bag a = -5;
a = a + 10;

if a == 5 {
  yap("YAY");
}

else {
  yap("aww");
}
```
expected output:
YAY
while loops are in this language as well. So as string concatenation
In this language, true is fax, and false is cap. "!" (or not) is no.

So if you want to say !false, you say, no cap, which is the same as true, which is false
EG:
```
yap(no cap);
```
Expected output:

fax.

There's also: while loops
